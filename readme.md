🚀 Resume Screening App with Python & Machine Learning

Hello everyone! 👋
I’ve recently been working on strengthening my Machine Learning and NLP skills and built a hands-on project to apply these concepts in a real-world scenario.

🧠 Project Overview:
I developed a Resume Screening & Categorization App that automatically classifies resumes into relevant job categories using machine learning techniques.

🔍 Key Features:

Supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT resume uploads

Text cleaning and preprocessing using NLP techniques

TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features

Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for accurate classification

Interactive Streamlit web application with Light & Dark theme options

🛠 Tech Stack:

Python

Scikit-learn (SVM, TF-IDF)

NLP

Streamlit

Joblib

💡 This project helped me understand the end-to-end ML pipeline, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and UI design.

I’m continuing to learn, experiment, and improve step by step 🚀
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
